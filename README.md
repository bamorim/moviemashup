# MovieMashup

I made this app in one night, just for fun. This version is working with pt-br movie titles.

A fun app that, given a word, get a random movie and replaces a random word in the movie name with the given word.

Example:
Given the word "Doge", the app can return (randomly) some of those names:

- The Incredible Doge
- Doge Swan
- The Sixth Doge
